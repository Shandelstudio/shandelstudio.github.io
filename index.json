[{"content":"Shandel is an independent game studio built around one simple idea: games should be fun first, clever second, and never predictable. We design tight gameplay loops, bold mechanics, and systems that reward curiosity and skill. No filler, no clones, no trend-chasing.\nWe work fast, experiment often, and ship what we believe in. Every project is treated like a lab—ideas are tested, broken, rebuilt, and polished until they’re worth playing. Shandel exists to make games that feel alive in the player’s hands, not just good in a trailer.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/shandelstudio/about/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"about"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/shandelstudio/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"Brick Gigil is not your typical brick breaker.
