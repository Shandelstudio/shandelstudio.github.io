This Privacy Policy explains how **Brick Gigil** (“the Game”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) handles your information.

By downloading or playing Brick Gigil, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

## **1. About Brick Gigil**

Brick Gigil is a **brick breaker mobile game** suitable for all ages.

The Game is designed to be played **offline** and **does not require an internet connection** for normal gameplay.

---

## **2. No Data Collection**

We **do not** collect, store, or process any personal data from users of Brick Gigil.

Specifically:

* We **do not** create or require user accounts.
* We **do not** collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or contact details.

All game-related information (such as scores, progress, and settings) is stored **locally on your device only**.

We do **not** have access to this information and it is never sent to our servers.

## **3. No Internet Requirement**

Brick Gigil:
* **Does not require** an internet connection to play.
* **Does not automatically** send any data to us.
* **Does not include** online features, login, or cloud saves.

You can enjoy the full game **completely offline**.

---

## **4. Permissions**

Brick Gigil is designed to use minimal permissions.
* We **do not** access your contacts, photos, location, microphone, or camera.
* Any technical permissions required by the operating system (if any) are used only to make the game function correctly and **not to collect personal data**.

Parents can allow their children to play without concern for tracking, profiling, or data sharing.

---

## **5. Children’s Privacy**

Brick Gigil is suitable for all ages.
* We **do not** knowingly collect any personal information from children.
* Since the Game **does not collect data** at all, there is no personal information about children stored by us.

If you believe that a child has somehow provided us with personal information outside the Game (for example, via separate contact), please contact us so we can delete it.

## **6. Third-Party Services**

Brick Gigil:

* **Does not use third-party** analytics SDKs.
* **Does not use social media** plugins.
* **Does not integrate third-party** login (e.g., Google, Facebook).

Because we do not collect data and do not use third-party tools for tracking, there is no data shared with third parties for advertising or analytics.

---

## **7. Data Security**

Since we **do not collect or store user data** on our servers, there is no personal data of yours for us to secure.

Game progress and settings remain on your device, under the security of your own phone or tablet. We recommend using basic device security (such as a passcode or biometric lock).

---

## **8. Your Rights**

Because we **do not collect or store personal data** via Brick Gigil, there is generally no personal information for you to access, modify, or delete.

If you contact us separately and provide personal data (for example, by sending us an email), you may have rights under applicable laws (such as GDPR or similar), including the right to request deletion of that information. If you want to exercise such rights, please contact us.

## **9. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.

We recommend reviewing this Privacy Policy occasionally to stay informed about how we handle privacy.
