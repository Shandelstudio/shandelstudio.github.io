**Last updated:** [Date]

This Privacy Policy explains how **Brick Gigil** (“the Game”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) handles information about you. We are committed to protecting your privacy and designing the Game in a way that respects data protection laws, including the EU/EEA GDPR and US children’s privacy rules such as COPPA.

By downloading or playing Brick Gigil, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

## 1. About Brick Gigil

- Brick Gigil is a brick breaker mobile game suitable for all ages.  
- The Game is designed to be played offline and does **not** require an internet connection for normal gameplay.

---

## 2. No Data Collection

During normal gameplay, we **do not** collect, store, or process any personal data.

Specifically:

- No user accounts are required.  
- No names, emails, phone numbers, or contact details are collected.  
- No location data is collected.  
- No device identifiers (e.g., advertising IDs) are tracked.  
- No analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs are used.  
- No data is shared with third parties.  

All game-related information (scores, level progress, settings) stays on your device. We **cannot access** it, and it is **not** sent to our servers.

Because we do not process personal data in normal gameplay, no GDPR legal basis is needed, and there is no profiling or automated decision-making.

The only time information may be shared is if you **choose** to send a level suggestion via email:

We will only use this to:
