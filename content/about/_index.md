Shandel is an independent game studio built around one simple idea: games should be fun first, clever second, and never predictable. We design tight gameplay loops, bold mechanics, and systems that reward curiosity and skill. No filler, no clones, no trend-chasing.

We work fast, experiment often, and ship what we believe in. Every project is treated like a lab—ideas are tested, broken, rebuilt, and polished until they’re worth playing. Shandel exists to make games that feel alive in the player’s hands, not just good in a trailer.
